💡 Code Examples
Track Any Satellite
pythonfrom src.orbit_predictor import SatelliteOrbitPredictor

predictor = SatelliteOrbitPredictor()
predictor.load_tle_file('stations.tle')

# Get ISS position right now
x, y, z = predictor.predict_position('ISS (ZARYA)', datetime.utcnow())
print(f"ISS Position: {x:.1f}, {y:.1f}, {z:.1f} km")
Collision Detection
pythonfrom src.collision_detector import CollisionDetector

detector = CollisionDetector(warning_distance_km=50)
analysis = detector.analyze_close_approach(predictor, 'ISS (ZARYA)', 'CSS (TIANHE)')

if analysis['collision_risk'] == 'HIGH':
    print("⚠️ COLLISION WARNING!")
3D Visualization
pythonfrom src.visualization import SatelliteVisualizer

visualizer = SatelliteVisualizer()
x, y, z = predictor.generate_orbit_path('ISS (ZARYA)', duration_hours=2)
visualizer.plot_single_satellite(x, y, z, 'ISS (ZARYA)')
